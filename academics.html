                        <p class="section-text"> Dance, drama, music and media & visual art help students develop knowledge and skills that can be applied in many other endeavours. 
						Participation in the arts encourages innovative, creative, critical and “out of the box” thinking. Arts courses help students deepen their awareness and 
						appreciation of diverse perspectives and provide ways of perceiving, interpreting, organizing and questioning various aspects of our world.

						Participation in the arts encourages students to be responsible and critically literate members of society as they become self-aware and self-confident. 
						Learning through the arts fosters integration of a student's sensory, cognitive and motor capacities while being intellectually rigorous disciplines that 
						use complex symbols to communicate meaning and understanding. The arts curriculum in each of the subject areas is based on four central ideas: developing creativity, 
						communicating, understanding culture and making connections.</p>

					<h5 class="section-title text-center pb-80">Business Studies</h5>
                        <p class="section-text"> Business is an integral part of every young adult’s future. It influences their careers, incomes and opportunities for personal 
						enterprise. Business has a significant effect on the standard of living and the quality of life of Canadians, while having a growing impact on the environment 
						in which they live. Young adults must be prepared to engage in business activities with confidence and competence, both nationally and internationally.

					Students who pursue a business education will develop an understanding of how business functions, the role it plays in society and the opportunities it generates. 
					Business studies creates a strong foundation for those who wish to train in specialized areas such as management, international business, marketing, finance, accounting, 
					entrepreneurship and information & communication technology, whether through practical applications in the workplace or in postsecondary education.</p> 
                    </div>

						<h5 class="section-title text-center pb-80"> Science</h5>
                        <p class="section-text">Science has played an increasingly important role in the lives of all Canadians, underpinning much of what we take for granted, from life-saving pharmaceuticals 
						to clean water, the places in which we live and work, and communication via information technologies.

						A scientifically and technologically literate person is one who can read and understand common media reports about science and technology, critically evaluate the information presented 
						and confidently engage in discussions and decision-making activities regarding issues that involve science and technology.

						The science curriculum, including biology, chemistry, earth and space science, environmental science and physics provides students with the opportunity to achieve excellence and a high 
						degree of scientific literacy while maintaining a sense of wonder about the world around them.
						</p>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<h5 class="section-title text-center pb-80"> Mathematics</h5>
                        <p class="section-text"> Today’s mathematics curriculum must prepare students for their future roles in society. It must equip them with essential mathematical knowledge
						and skills and most importantly, with the ability and incentive to continue on their own learning. The development of mathematical knowledge is a gradual process. 
						Thus, a coherent and continuous program is necessary to help students recognize the underlying principles of mathematics.

						The mathematics courses offered at the secondary level build upon the fundamentals of important skills, concepts, processes, and attitudes that are fostered through elementary school.
						The strands used are similar to those of the elementary program, with adjustments made to reflect the new directions mathematics takes in secondary school. The mathematics curriculum 
						promotes lifelong learning for students by encouraging the application of problem-solving skills to other disciplines and real world situations.

						Using a variety of instructional, assessment and evaluation strategies, teachers provide numerous opportunities for students to develop skills of inquiry, reasoning, problem solving and 
						communication as they investigate and learn fundamental concepts. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts – to the goals and concerns of the world in which 
						they live – will motivate students to learn and to become lifelong learners.

								of current computer technology while preparing them to engage with emerging technologies. Computer studies is the study of ways of representing objects and processes in 
								computer technology. It involves defining and analyzing problems – designing solutions and developing, testing and maintaining computer programs.

							Computer studies is relevant for all students because it incorporates a broad range of transferable problem-solving skills and techniques, including logical thinking, creative design, synthesis,
